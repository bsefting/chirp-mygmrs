# CHIRP Project

This is a fork of the official git repository for the
__[CHIRP](https://chirp.danplanet.com)__ project.

The intention of this fork is to add back in the MyGMRS.com integration while still
maintaining the updates from Dan's original repository.  He removed the integration
back in January 2023 because of an objection to MyGMRS wanting this as a Premium-only
feature.

For Python3 driver testing status, see [this file](tests/Python3_Driver_Testing.md).
